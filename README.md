# Randomizr
This project includes a React and React Native application to random generate questions for a weekly standup at your company, icebreakers and design challenges. This project is a Proof of Concept for code re-usage between native and web.

## Getting Started
`$ git clone git@github.com:Ronnyrr/randomizr-universal.git`

`$ cd randomizr-universal && npm install`

`$ npm start` (run native via Expo)

or

`$ npm run web` (to run the web project in development mode)

## Credits
This project is forked from the [React Native Starter Kit](https://github.com/mcnamee/react-native-starter-kit). A React Native + React (web) & Firebase (optional) boilerplate app to get you up and running. Native and web views are seperated, but the business logic is shared between platforms.
