# Randomizr
This project includes a React and React Native application to random generate questions for a weekly standup at your company, icebreakers and design challenges. This project is a Proof of Concept for code re-usage between native and web.

## Getting Started
`$ git clone git@github.com:Ronnyrr/randomizr-universal.git`

`$ cd randomizr-universal && npm install`

`$ npm start` (run native via Expo)

or

`$ npm run web` (to run the web project in development mode)

`$ npm run build` (to run the web project in production mode)


## Credits
This project is forked from the [React Native Starter Kit](https://github.com/mcnamee/react-native-starter-kit). The code sharing concept is used from this boilerplate. It's a React Native + React (web) & Firebase (optional) boilerplate app to get you up and running. Native and web views are separated, but the business logic is shared between platforms. For the web part another great boilerplate is used. [React Prime](https://github.com/JBostelaar/react-prime) provides a excellent start for your React web projects, containing optimized development and production builds with support for SSR.
